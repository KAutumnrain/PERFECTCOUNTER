This is kind of a mess, so let's run through what's going on here;

First is the hyper basic default for Winamp's ATF system. It simply gets the artist and track name from metadata,
or if it can't, uses a part of the file name. 

Next is a bit messier. Streams have an infinite duration, but that duration is set to '0' internally.
If it's 0 and playing content, we assume it's a stream and fetch the stream URL.

If it's longer than that, it's either a local file or tracker file. 

Every tracker file I've ever seen lacks an 'Album' field. So assuming you're tagging your stuff, 
You can abuse that fact and identify said file as a tracker file without checking extensions. 

If you're using vorbis comments and this isn't working as expected for you because they aren't being read, Sorry.
I'll likely be changing this to check the decoder but until that occurs I have nothing for ya right now.
